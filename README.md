# Lithostitched

Lithostitched is a library mod with new configurability and compatibility enhancements for worldgen.

## Description

This mod introduces new tools for datapack and modded worldgen developers to utilize, with the aim of increasing inter-project compatibility and expanding configurability in general. Currently, there are features such as:
- Biome modifiers
- Template pool injectors
- Surface rule modifiers

All of these new capabilities are **data-driven**! Take a look at the [Lithostitched Docs](https://lithostitched.worldgen.dev/) website for more information.


*(Code for the mod is accessible in the other branches.)*
